Scripts, results, and visualizations analyzing the performance history of the New York Philharmonic

Use ```nyphil.R``` in R to download, transform, and analyze the entire performance history of the New York Philharmonic. Or just take ```ny_phil_programs.csv``` and import that into your environment of choice (including Excel or Numbers).

*Note that my download includes performances through the end of 2016. The original source is dynamically updating, so if you run the script, you will likely pull some newer results. You will also have to change a couple numbers, which I hard coded based on the size of the repository when I downloaded it.*

Original data can be found on the [NY Philharmonic Archive GitHub site](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/).

You can also read my blog post, [Data mining the New York Philharmonic performance history](http://pushpullfork.com/2017/01/data-mining-the-new-york-philharmonic-performance-history/), explaining the use of the scripts and the results of my analysis.
